# Template Files

This directory contains template files for reference when creating new content.

## Usage

When you want to add new publications, talks, or teaching content:

1. Copy a template file from the appropriate subdirectory
2. Move it to the corresponding collection directory:
   - Publications: `_publications/`
   - Talks: `_talks/`
   - Teaching: `_teaching/`
3. Rename the file with the appropriate date and title
4. Edit the YAML front matter and content

## Directory Structure

- `publications/` - Templates for academic publications
- `talks/` - Templates for conference talks and presentations
- `teaching/` - Templates for teaching activities and courses

## Note

Files in this `templates/` directory will NOT be built by Jekyll or included in the sitemap. They are kept here purely as reference examples.

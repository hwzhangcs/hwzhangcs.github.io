Hi! I’m **Hanwen Zhang (张瀚文)**, a sophomore undergraduate in **Computer Science and Technology** at **Sichuan University (SCU)**, enrolled in the **Top-notch Student Training Program 2.0 — Honors Class**.

**Seeking:** **Remote research internship** (video generation / world models / multimodal & LLM systems).  
I’m particularly interested in building **efficient, controllable, and reproducible** ML pipelines where **modeling + systems** matter together.

## Highlights
- **Rank #1 / 12**, SCU Honors Class (Top-notch Student Training Program 2.0)
- **GPA: 3.98 / 4.00**
- **Software Copyright:** *Granular Network Threat Detection System* (Reg. No. **2025SR1158898**, Jul 2025)
- **Leadership:** Vice President, **Sichuan University AI Club** (elected 2025)
- **Competitive Programming:** **CCF CSP 250 / 500** (Apr 2025)

## Research Interests
I’m exploring research at the intersection of **video generation**, **world models**, and **multimodal/LLM systems**, with a strong focus on **efficiency, controllability, and reproducibility**.

- **Video generation (diffusion / flow-style):** controllable synthesis; speed–quality trade-offs; budget-aware sampling/training.
- **World models & predictive learning:** representation + dynamics for prediction, long-horizon consistency, and planning-oriented evaluation.
- **Multimodal/LLM systems:** using language/multimodal models as interfaces for control, evaluation, and agentic workflows; clean, reproducible infra.

## Education
**Sichuan University (SCU)** — Chengdu, China  
**B.Eng. in Computer Science and Technology** (Top-notch Student Training Program 2.0 — Honors Class)  
Sep 2024 – Present  
- **GPA: 3.98 / 4.00**; **Rank #1 / 12**
- Core coursework: Data Structures, Calculus/Advanced Mathematics, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics

---

## What I’m doing now
- **Turning ideas into measurable baselines:** reading + reproducing key methods related to diffusion/flow and predictive modeling, with clean configs and ablation templates.
- **Building reproducible infrastructure:** training/eval scripts, experiment tracking, and standardized reporting to make comparisons reliable.
- **Exploring compute-aware optimization:** an early-stage idea combining **Rectified Flow** training with **RL-style adaptation** (budget-aware schedules / step allocation).
